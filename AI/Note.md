# variance vs bias
high variance: the result is very different

high bias: accuracy is low

simple model: high Bias, low Variance

complex model: low Bias, high Variance

# solution
## Bagging
Divid sample to M[n]
Train n models
Take the average result of n models

Random Forest = Decision Tree + Bagging
